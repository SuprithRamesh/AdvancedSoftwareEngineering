## Agile Manifesto
* **Individuals and Interactions** over processes and tools
* **Working Software** over comprehensive documentation
* **Customer Collaboration** over contract negotiation
* **Responding to Change** over following a plan

## Agile Principle
```
1.  Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2.  Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.
3.  Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months)
4.  Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
5.  Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
6.  Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
7.  Working software is the primary measure of progress
8.  Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
9.  Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
10. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
11. Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
12. Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly
```

## Quality Focus
```
Tools and Techniques such as
1.  Continuous Integration
2.  Automated Unit Testing
3.  Pair Programming
4.  Test Driven Development
5.  Design Patterns
6.  Behaviour Driven Development
7.  Domain-Driven Design
8.  Code Refactoring
9.  Others
```

## Agile Methodologies
```
Based on requirement of SDLC, agile methodolgies vary, for example
1.  [Extreme Programming (XP)](./ExtremeProgramming.md)
2.  Lean software development
3.  Kanban
4.  Scrum
5.  Scrumban
6.  Others like Rapid Application Development (RAD), Feature driven development (FDD)
```

## Agile Practices
```
Based on selected Agile methodology, basic practices include
1.  Acceptance test-driven development (ATDD)
2.  Agile modeling
3.  Agile testing
4.  Backlogs (Product and Sprint)
5.  Behavior-driven development (BDD)
6.  Business analyst designer method (BADM)
7.  Continuous integration (CI)
8.  Cross-functional team
9.  Domain-driven design (DDD)
10. Information radiators (scrum board, task board, visual management board, burndown chart)
11. Iterative and incremental development (IID)
12. Low-code development platforms
13. Pair programming
14. Planning poker
15. Refactoring
16. Retrospective
17. Scrum events (sprint planning, daily scrum, sprint review and retrospective)
18. Story-driven modeling
19. Test-driven development (TDD)
20. Timeboxing
21. User story
22. User story mapping
23. Velocity Tracking
```

## Pitfalls
```
* Lack of overall product design
* Adding stories to an iteration in progress
* Lack of sponsor support
* Insufficient training
* Product owner role is not properly filled
* Teams are not focused
* Excessive preparation/planning
* Problem-solving in the daily standup
* Assigning tasks
* Scrum master as a contributor
* Lack of test automation
* Allowing technical debt to build up
* Attempting to take on too much in an iteration
* Fixed time, resources, scope, and quality
* Developer burnout
```
